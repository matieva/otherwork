/*         AGGREGATE FUNCTION        */
/*        
DEFINITION: An aggregate function in SQL performs a calculation on multiple values and returns a single value.

EXAMPLE_1:
fra tabell:
LastFinishedDegreeDate
2020-01-30


SELECT
    MAX(ToDate) AS LastFinishedDegreeDate
        FROM LoggLogg

- gir 1 verdi


EXAPLE_2:
-
SELECT
    PersonID, ToDate
        FROM LoggLogg
        WHERE PersonID <= 10003  FÅR Å HA MINDRE RECORDS VIST FRAM
        ORDER BY PersonID, ToDate
    
    1 VERDI FRA BRUKER 1
    3 VERDIER FRA BRUKER 2
    2 VERDI FRA BRUKER 3

    FINNE UT LastFinishedDegreeDate FOR BRUKER 2 og 3

    WRITE A QUERY THAT WILL GIVE THE HIGHEST DATE FROM EACH USER(PersonID)


    HOW TO DO IT:
    SELECT
        PersonID, MAX(ToDate) AS LastFinishingDegreeDate
            FROM LoggLogg
            WHERE PersonID <= 10003
            GROUP BY PersonID
