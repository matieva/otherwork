authentication - someone is who they say they are. userame and password SQL Server Login. Windows authentication remembered login. 
authorization - what someone is allowed to do. user or role. omega uses role. 
Server Roles - sysadmin, securityadmin
Database Roles - af_developer, af_user, db_accessadmin, db_owner, db_securityadmin. Appframe roles, usually af role. developer will have both af and db access.
connecting to sql server.
Login - server specific, used for authentication, may be added to server roles. Server roles will be added to you login, not your user.
User - user will be created in each of your databases and added to database roles.
rocommended security measures - authentication log, firewall, password requirements, handle permissions correctly in views and similiar. 
SQL Injection - be ware. prevent
permissions - needed for all objects (SELECT, INSERT, EXECUTE). sstp_Database_Maintenance_ApplyPermissions
af_user (Appframe User) - EXECUTE permission scaler functions, stored procedure, table types. SELECT permission table valued functions, views.
    INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE permission through views. 
af_developer (Appframe developer) - + from af_user is view definition of all objects. F1. scalar functions, stored procedure, table types, table valued functions, tables, views.

appframe definitions
Domain - usually project or company
Role - table permissions, capability
User and Login mapped together. map our login to the user with the same name. suser sname function you will retrieve your server login name.
    But in appframe we map this to the user wit the same name, so this is also the name of the user. two different things just mapped together.
difference between select data and change data. 


tbv- table view (Current Domain)
atbv - table view curremt domain
abx - table view all domains
aviw - View. application view not application table view. 
My Permissions(Current Domain). sview_System_MyPermissions_CurrentDomain. Login SUSER_SNAME() how we distinguish who are you. 
atbl - insert triggers. A trigger is a special type of stored procedure that automatically runs when an event occurs in the database server




exception i appframe security checks (this is part of trigger, the setup is as following insert, transaction, delete ):
BEGIN
    GOTO RollbackTransaction
END

RollbackTransaction:
    DECLARE @RaiseErrorUser NVARCHAR(128) = SUSER_SNAME()¨
    RAISEERROR('no insert permission', 18, 1, @RaiseErrorUser)
    ROLLBACK TRANSACTION 
    RETURN
ContinueTransaction:
    IF UPDATE(CUT)

custom trigger logic, not need to go thorugh when we use CUT function in ContinueTransaction
 + never allowed to skip security checks if you are updating something

USE Academy DB. Msg 916, not able to access the database under the current security context.
    trying to access a database you dont have access to
 1. Access to the server with login
 2. Have the access/permissions to the database.
create a database user map it to its login then they will be able to run this. aka the login was not mapped to a user in the AcademyDB database. 

SELECT * FROM stbv_System_Users. Msg 229, permisson was denied on the object 'stbv_System_Users', database 'AcademyDB', schema 'dbo'.
sql server level or appframe level?
testuser does not have the af_user role, or apply permissions have not been executed since stbv_System_Users was created. 
add testuser to the af_user role.  
-tbv


SELECT * FROM stbl_System_Users. Msg 229, SELECT permission was denied on the object 'stbl_Systems_Users', database 'AcademyDB', schema 'dbo'.
testuser is only a member of a af_user, not db_datareader or db_owner. therefore it does not have access to SELECT from tbl's.
-- ser at dette har noe med database å gjøre.

INSERT INTO stbl_System_Users
    (Login, LastName)

    ('test', 'Test')
Msg 229, The insert permission was denied on the object. 'stbl_System_Users', database 'AcademyDB', Schema 'dbo'.
user has select but not insert permission in the database.
testuser is only a member of af_user, not db_datawriter, db_owner or sysadmin which are required for handling tables directly.

from checks should be a view at the table. 
this is a security threat   

standard appframe security.
