common table expressions CTE using WITH clause

syntax:
WITH expression_name[(column_name [,...])]
AS
    (CTE_definition)
SQL_statement;


+ specify the expression name, which you can refer later in a query.

+ specify a list of comma-separated columns after the expression_name. The number of column must be the same as the number of columns defined in the CTE_definition. 
WITH expression_name (staff, sales, year) 


+ then, use the AS keyword after the expression name or column list if the column list is specified
AS (CTE_definition)


+ define a SELECT statement whose result set populates the common table expression.
(
    SELECT 
        first_name + ' ' + last_name
        SUM(quantity * list_price * (1 - discount)),
        YEAR(order_date)
    FROM
            sales.orders o
        INNER.JOIN sales.order_items i ON i.order_id = o.order_id
        INNER JOIN sales.staffs s ON s.staff_id = o.staff_id
        GROUP BY
            first_name + ' ' + last_name,
            year(order_date)
)

+ (finally) refer to the common table expression in a query (SQL_statement;) such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE

SELECT  
    staff,
    sales
FROM 
    cte_sales_amounts
WHERE 
    year = 2018;





- HEAP. tables stored unsorted, therefore inserts are done at the bottom. find information, read through everything
- CLUSTERED INDEXES. tables that are stored on one or more columns. inserted according to the sorting. 
- NON-CLUSTERED INDEXES. stored in addition to tables.
